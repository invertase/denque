# Benchmarks

Benchmarks have been tested against the following environment:

```
Darwin 17.0.0 x64
Node.JS 9.4.0
V8 6.2.414.46-node.17
Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-7700K CPU @ 4.20GHz × 8
```

### 1000 items in queue

```
 (3 x shift + 3 x push ops per 'op')

    denque x 64,365,425 ops/sec ±0.69% (92 runs sampled)
    double-ended-queue x 26,646,882 ops/sec ±0.47% (94 runs sampled)
```

### 2 million items in queue

```
 (3 x shift + 3 x push ops per 'op')

    denque x 61,994,249 ops/sec ±0.26% (95 runs sampled)
    double-ended-queue x 26,363,500 ops/sec ±0.42% (91 runs sampled)
```

### Splice

```
 (1 x splice per 'op') - initial size of 100,000 items

    denque.splice x 925,749 ops/sec ±22.29% (77 runs sampled)
    native array splice x 7,777 ops/sec ±8.35% (50 runs sampled)
```

### Remove

```
 (1 x remove + 10 x push per 'op') - initial size of 100,000 items

    denque.remove x 2,635,275 ops/sec ±0.37% (95 runs sampled)
    native array splice - Fails to complete: "JavaScript heap out of memory"
```

### Remove One

```
 (1 x removeOne + 10 x push per 'op') - initial size of 100,000 items

    denque.removeOne x 1,088,240 ops/sec ±0.21% (93 runs sampled)
    native array splice x 5,300 ops/sec ±0.41% (96 runs sampled)
```
